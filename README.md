# WordPress Theme with Tailwind CSS

This WordPress theme is designed with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. To build and compile the CSS for this theme, you need to run the `gulp` command.

## Requirements

To work with this theme, you need to have Node.js and Gulp installed on your system.

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime required for running Gulp and managing dependencies. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing Gulp

Gulp is a toolkit for automating tasks in your development workflow. To install Gulp globally on your system, you can use npm (Node Package Manager), which is installed automatically with Node.js.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g gulp
```
